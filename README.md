## About
CommonPaths was developed by [MVtransportation](https://www.mvtransit.com/) in partner with [King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro.aspx?) as a solution to the current state of disorganization that is pedestrian pathway data. The system can collect and serve high-fidelity pedestrian pathway information in a standardized and computable format. It can accurately describe, translate and serve the data in a usable and actionable format for consumption by various applications and users with mobility impairments.
